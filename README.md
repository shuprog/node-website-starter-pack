# Node Website Starter Pack

A *really* simple node website starter pack. Just serves static files from
`/public`, and pulls in bootstrap from a CDN.

# Installation

Install the latest stable version of node. You can do so
[here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), but I would recommend following [this
guide](http://benjaminparnell.github.io/2015/installing-node/).

Once you have node installed, open a terminal and go into the directory that
you have cloned this project too. Then run:

```sh
npm start
```

And the server will start running on port 8080. Go to `localhost:8080` in your
browser and you should see the site.
